# Introduction to GANs using the MNIST dataset

Here are the codes used for a school project.
It's an introduction to GANs, and it helped me understand how to implement one.

## Basic understanding of a GAN:

## Architectures used for this project:
### Discriminator

### Generator

## Results
Here are the results, for 20,000 epochs.

It also seems that RMDProp works better in terms of results and running time than Adam, for the parameters that I have used.
